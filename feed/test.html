					<p>
						The

					</p>
					<p>
						Instead, the
						<a href="https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#coordination">Coordination</a>
						should explicitly list where incubations are intended to graduate to,
						separately from groups expected to coordinate with as relevant.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also the <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#process">Process</a>
						section should also describe exit conditions for an incubation,
						for how / whether a proposal should be abandoned/dropped from the group,
						or how a proposal should complete incubation and considerations for how to choose
						which Working Group it should graduate to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some specifics: in the
						<a href="https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#mission">Mission</a>
						section up front it says
						‚Äúto develop privacy-focused web standards and APIs‚Äù.
						That should for example be changed to say incubate, e.g.
						‚Äúto incubate privacy-focused web standards and APIs‚Äù.
					</p>
					<p>
						In
						<a href="https://github.com/privacycg/privacycg.github.io/issues/2">issue #2</a>,
						there is mention of
						‚Äú2. The deliverable phase, AKA specification.‚Äù
						This should be dropped from the CG charter, as when the incubation phase has completed
						for a proposal, the next step should be to transition it to a working group.
